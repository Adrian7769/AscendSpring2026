Google Authentication Flow (As far as i understand it). 
1.) First step is to acquire a client secret json file from google cloud console. So you have to create Oauth2 Credentials.
2.) Once you have these credentials you use them to receive a code from google. You only really have to do this once if you have a token refresh method but 
3.) for Authentication I believe the code is just to verify if you are actually you. so they require a user to enter their own email and password.
3.) Once you have the code, you send this to google and you get a token. So you need to be able to handle the response from google that contains the token. I store it in tokenCache.
4.) You also need methods to read the token file and write to the token file. The token also expires every hour, so you need a method to be able to handle refreshes. 
5.) for refreshes You can just send google the token, and they will give you another updated one. every time the client makes a get request, it checks the status of the token. So basically we never have to get another code.
 To summarize Client Secret -> User Code -> Token -> Refresh Token (This last step ideally runs forever)
